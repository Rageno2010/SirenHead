            Siren Head is a 40-foot-tall unusual skeleton creature with a heavily emaciated, near-skeletal frame covered in dried, mummified flesh the color of rusty metal. Its limbs are disproportionately long and thin, with arms as long as its legs, ending in huge, bony hands. In place of its head and neck is a thin pole of flesh with two metal sirens attached on either side (hence the name) and several black wires snaking around its "neck" and into its upper shoulders, pressed against its abdomen. These speakers are the only metal parts of its body, fused to the neck by tendrils of skin and capable of swivelling around it much like the head of an owl. Some images depict Siren Head's speakers with toothy, lipless, human-like jaws and a long, thin, retractable snake-like tongue, though Henderson has said that the teeth are only visible on a certain radiofrequency.

            Due to its name, Siren Head's speakers can play various types of loud noises, typically air raid sirens, garbled music, conversations, imitations of people close to the victims, numbers station broadcasts or emergency broadcasts. Trevor has revealed that Siren Head is able to pick up sounds it hears from the airwaves and “repurpose” them and while it doesn’t make sense to us, it is a conscious choice on its part. This makes Siren Head a very clever creature.

            When mimicking a human, a distinctive distortion in the voices is always present, due to the sounds being played through sirens instead of vocal chords or other organic means of creating noise.
